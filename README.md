# Crowd-Sourced Food Bank  

YouTube Demo URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcLPDS-H8Tc&vq=hd720p  

Webapp is configured to use HTTPS only, will redirect to HTTPS automatically : https://csfb-app.azurewebsites.net/   
This is to prevent browser warnings and also apparently I am observing improved loading times on HTTPS.

Built using PHP, HTML, CSS & MySQL.
Hosted on Microsoft Azure.

N.B.: To conserve my Azure student credits, I have stopped the DB & the Web App has been scaled down to Free F1 tier.
If webpage does not load, please allow warm up by refreshing the page (F5, Ctrl+R). Once it's up, every webpage will load quickly.

Also, I try to stop my Database server, but it automatically turns on again in 1 month. Please understand if User Acc auth & food records are not working.

** If you want to test, mail me at nokhu.nag@gmail.com so I can turn these on **
